## UML

### Note: The [UML](./doc/UML_Final.png) (final version) has been updated for the Final Checkpoint

#### Previous Version (deprecated):
~~The UML is devided into 3 parts, since it's too complicated that having them in one single diagram would make it really hard to read.~~

* ~~***[UML_Overall](./doc/UML_Overall.png)*** focuses on the most important anticipated classes~~
* ~~***[UML_pageLevelDetails](./doc/UML_pageLevelDetails.png)*** provides a deeper view of the classes, interfaces and their relationships, focusing on the pages, fragments and their relationships~~
  * ~~how they communicate with/generate other pages~~
  * ~~how they interact with the databse~~
* ~~***[UML_FragmentLevelDetails](./doc/UML_FragmentLevelDetails.png)*** is all about the ViewBookFragment class.~~
  ~~Since we decide (for now) to have different button logics (requesting/returning/borrowing...) for the page used to view the book details, according to the book to be viewed and the user openning this page, the classes like ViewBookFragment will have 6 ways of interacting with other classes (though they will be used by other classes in the same way).~~
